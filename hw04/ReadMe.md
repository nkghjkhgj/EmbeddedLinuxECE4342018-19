For the first two parts I have included the c programs in folder. 
  I used port 1 and port 0 for the buttons and USR2 and USR3 as LEDs, based on gpioToggle.c.
  I used an open source library called iolib for opening a gpio port.

For LCD I included my shell file which adds annotation to a certain image. I added "here it goes" to my previous image which displays my name at left corner.
Rotations are done by changing the angle in on.sh file from 90 to 180.

ReadMe.md is missing.  Add it and I'll regrade.

Looks good for a start.  
Need to demo the LCD to me.
I don't see your memory map.
