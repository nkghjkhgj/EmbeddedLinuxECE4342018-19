For the first two parts I have included the c programs in folder. 
  I used port 1 and port 0 for the buttons and USR2 and USR3 as LEDs, based on gpioToggle.c.
  I used an open source library called iolib for opening a gpio port.

For LCD I included my shell file which adds annotation to a certain image. I added "here it goes" to my previous image which displays my name at left corner.
Rotations are done by changing the angle in on.sh file from 90 to 180.
