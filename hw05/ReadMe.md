For homework 5:

Make: 
  I learned how to edit makefile to manipulate make process and the results are put into "make" folder.
Cross-Compling:
  I installed kernel and cross complier on host computer and use the cross complier to compile an a.out file
  which fits for arm processors. The screenshot of outputs is stored in the homework folder called outputs.png
Kernel Modules:
  I followed Derek and learned how to build and insert a kernel moduele. The one question I remain would be how to
  delete a module. Right now I just do system rebooting.
  I have successfully modified the drive and I'll demo tomorrow on 10/3/2018
  
 Challenge: 
 build_kernel.sh didn't work at the beginnig, tried newest version of ubuntu, still didn't work. Had to install a 64-bt 
 system, and the problem resolved.
